44Z = (ZZZ, AAA)
ZZZ = (AAA, AAA)



starting points: AAA,22A
AAA:
    -> 22A -> 33M -> 44Z = 3, OR
    -> 22A -> 33M -> 44Z -> ZZZ = 4
22A:
    -> 33M -> 44Z = 2, OR
    -> 33M -> 44Z -> ZZZ = 3

lcm(3,3) is better than lcm(2,4) is better than lcm(2,3):

step 0: [AAA,2AA]
step 1: [22A,33M]
step 2: [33M,44Z]
step 3: [44Z,ZZZ]
